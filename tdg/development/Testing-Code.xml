	In a programmers daily life errors are unavoidable (alas). Therefore
	there must be some means to track down errors quickly. &lg; provides
	two methods for finding errors in the code as well as logging specific
	events in the program flow. The following links deal with hunting bugs
	in &lg; code.

	    Logging with &lg;
	  </para>
	  <para>
	    In the previous sections there were repeatedly references to the
	    logfile that is written during a &prog; session. Because we were
	    only interested in the output we wanted to produce with the &lg;
	    examples, the details associated with logging were left out there.
	    However, since the logging mechanism implied by &prog; is rather
	    powerful there shall be some additional explanations regarding this
	    topic. To make use of the various features related to logging, you
	    should read the following developers documentation.

	    The &lg; debugger
	  </para>
	  <para>
	    For checking errors in a &lg; program during runtime there is a
	    debugger available. Since the respective package is not part of
	    the standard installation, it has to be installed manually:
	    <literal>yast2-debugger</literal>. Its usage is explained in the
	    developers ducumentation. Please follow the link below.
