If you have installed SUSE LINUX on Server or Desktop, you have seen YaST in
action. Basically YaST provides Installation, Configuration and Administration.
YaST which stands for Yet another Setup Tool guides you through the
installation procedure and later during the system configuration. Once the
system is configured and running, web-updater offers a unique
system maintenance service.

  <para>YaST is a key difference between SUSE LINUX and
other Linux offerings. YaST manages all of the system configuration data behind
the scenes and yet allows the user the freedom of manual configuration and
editing of the system data if they so desire.
