    <h1>What is a YaST II module?</h1>
    
    <p>There are different types of YaST II modules:
      
    <ul>
      <li>Program modules</li>
      <li>Process modules</li>
      <li>Plugin modules</li>
      <li>Object file modules</li>
      <li>Script modules</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>Currently only the first type (program module) and the last type (Script modules) 
      are being used. The different
      module types differ in how they are called and how the communicate with other
      components.</p>

    <h2>Program modules</h2>
    <p>A YaST II program module is an executable UNIX binary with the following properties:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>It can be given an arbitrary number of arguments. Each argument has YCP ASCII syntax.</li>
      <li>When called it issues an ASCII representation of a YCP value to stdout. Now there
	are two possibilities:
	<ul>
	  <li>If that value has the form <tt><b>result(</b></tt><i>value</i><tt><b>)</tt></b>, i.e.
	    a term with the symbol <tt><b>result</b></tt> and exactly one argument, the module
	    terminates immediately afterwards and thus closes its stdout and stdin. <i>value</i> is
	    considered the be the result, return value or exit code of the module (whichever
	    name for it you like best).</li>

	  <li>If that value has any other form, the module reads on stdin and wait for 
	    an YCP value in ASCII representation. The module assumes that the value it has issued
	    is now interpreted by the user interface and waits for an answer. When it has read
	    one YCP value on stdin it considers this to be the answer of the user interface.
	    Now the whole loop starts over again and the module issues the next value on stdout.</li>
	</ul>
      <li>The program does not terminate without first having issued
	<tt><b>result(</b></tt><i>value</i><tt><b>)</tt></b>
    </ul>
