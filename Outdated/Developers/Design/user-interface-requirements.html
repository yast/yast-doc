<H1>YaST2: Design: User interface</H1>

<H3>Purpose</H3>
The user interface is used to exchange information with the user. It is used
to<br>
<br>
- inform the user about 'whats going on'<br>
- presenting data to the user<br>
- getting data from the user<br>
- offering context sensitive help<br>
- asking 'what to do next'<br>
<p>
The user interface should be completely independant (and unaware of) the workflow
environment. It is controlled by a specific (network capable) command protocol which
makes no assumptions about the kind of user-side interface (e.g. text, graphics) available.
However, it might give some 'hints' on how to present data (e.g. tabular, horizontal menues, ...)
but neither the application (i.e. workflow module) nor the user interface itselft might rely on this.
<p>
The <b>separation of form</b> (user interface) <b>and function</b> (workflow) is essential.
<p>
Remark: With this concept, 
a purely optical re-design can be presented as a ´new and enhanced´
version ... for our marketroids.
<p>
<H3>Design parameters</h3>
<ul>
  text and graphic<br>
  <ul>
    generic syntax to describe 'masks'<br>
    'hints' for presentation are possible<br>
    usable on a teletype (e.g. line-oriented braille converter for visually impaired people)<br>
  </ul>
  Multilingual<br>
  <ul>Unicode ?<br>gnu gettext ?</ul>

  networking<br>
  <ul>
    interface protocol<br>
    transmission of <em>what</em> to present and <em>how</em> to present<br>
  </ul>

  expandable<br>
  <ul>
    transmission of graphics and sounds<br>
    version information in protocol<br>
  </ul>

  texts, strings, numerical values<br>
  <ul>input, output</ul>

  choices<br>
  <ul>checkbox, radiobutton, menue</ul>

  presentation<br>
  <ul>tables, multiple windows, alert box, progressbar, ...</ul>

  help<br>
  <ul>at any time (hotkey ! F1 ?), context sensitive</ul>

  demo-mode for pictures in the installation manual
  <ul>demo-frontend to reproduce every possible mask (filled with reasonable data)</ul>

  named masks<br>
  <ul>every mask (i.e. view presented to the user) must be non-ambiguously named
      and reproducable. The names are important for translators as checkmarks
      in the TeX source of the installation manual</ul>

  stand-alone vs. linked masks<br>
  <ul>most masks may be used either stand-alone (i.e. user selected just *this* workflow)
      or 'linked'. Here, linked means being part of a larger workflow with the possibility
      to go <i>back</i> and <i>forward</i>.</ul>

  checklist display<br>
  <ul>In a larger workflow, it is desirable to give the user information about
      the current path through the workflow. For example, a list of 'steps' with
      green checkmarks for 'step done', yellow mark for 'in progress', etc.</ul>

  background graphics<br>
  <ul>Help may be provided by background graphics. For example, a zoom-up of
      the registration page from the manual was suggested by I-Support</ul>

  KDE/Gnome<br>
  <ul>A special KDE or Gnome version of the user interface is desirable.</ul>
</ul>
<hr>
<H3>interface protocol</H3>
The protocol must
<ul>
<li>work over the network<br>
  break data stream in blocks<br>
  master/slave concept<br>
  timeouts, retransmissions<br>
</li>
<li>be safe<br>
  checksummed<br>
  retransmit on bad checksum<br>
</li>
<li>be secure<br>
  encoded/crypted (by ssh ?)<br>
</li>
<li>be small<br>
  compressed data ?<br>
</li>
<li>two way<br>
  revert master/slave<br>
  interface may send request to module<br>
</li>
</ul>
