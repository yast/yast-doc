<h1>YaST2: Resources: Framebuffer: Changing the Logo</h1>
This document describes how to change the boot-up graphic displayed
when booting with the framebuffer device.
<p>
<ol>

<big><strong><li>Overview</strong></big> <p> </p>

  <p>
     Before using the framebuffer device a new kernel has to be
     compiled -- the console drivers have to be configurated. </p>

  <p>
     Then on booting the system a small tux logo of the size 80x80
     is displayed. </p>

  <p>
     This document describes what has to be done to exchange this
     image. </p>


<big><strong><li>Purpose and Scope</strong></big> <p> </p>

  <p>
     This document doesn't describe what changes are necessary 
     within the code for an image with 8 bit color depth using 
     packed format.  This is already done within that 
     <a href="FrameBufferLogo.html">document</a>.</p>

  <p>
     This document describes how an images must be transformed
     to be displayed. </p>


<big><strong><li>The Graphic Format</strong></big> <p> </p>

  <p>
     An image is described by a color map. This color map holds
     214 colors of 24 bit color depth, 8 bit for each color
     channel of the RGB color space. </p>

  <p>
     A packed image of depth 8 bits using color registers (color map)
     is a image, within every pixel is described by exactly one index
     that points to the color map. </p>

  <p>
     Clearly spoken, each value within the picture definition 
     represents one color, identical index values are representing 
     identical colors. </p>


<big><strong><li>The Transformation</strong></big> <p> </p>

  <p>
     The easiest way is to transform the image to an XPM format.
     For this procedure <strong>xv</strong> can be used. </p>

  <p>
     The XPM format contains information about the picture size and also
     about the number of used colors. </p>

  <p>
     Only if the restriction holds that less or equal 214 colors are
     used, the image definition can replace the tux logo. <br>
     Otherwise the number of the colors have to be reduced, maybe by using
     a color metrik.</p>

  <p>
     The XPM format contains a list of colors and their representation
     within the 24 bit RGB color space. This information can taken directly
     to fill the color tables: linux_logo_red[], linux_logo_green[] and
     linux_logo_blue[]. The sequence of the definitions is arbitrary. </p>

  <p>
     The XPM format contains also a mapping table of printable ASCII
     characters which are representing an index -- such a string is representing
     a 24 bit color. </p>
   
  <p>
     The image itself is defined line per line. This means the sequence is
     defined -- but it is the same sequence like in the linux_logo[]. </p>

  <p>
     To get the replacement logo the printable ASCII character string has to be
     replaced by the index representing the color within the color maps. </p>

  <p>
     But pay attention, the colormap index starts at 32, the 
     first 32 colors are reserved. This means a value of 32 within the image
     definition means the first entry within the color maps!</p>


<big><strong><li>Details</strong></big> <p> </p>

  <p>
     For a rapid prototype to implement this transformation, have a look at
     <a href="image.c">the C source file</a>. </p>

<big><strong><li>Generation Infos</strong></big> <p> </p>

  <pre>
# call make image=imagefile
#           imagefile is a filename without extention !

special:
	gcc -DXPM_IMAGE=\"$(image)\" -DXPM_NAME=$(image) image.c
  </pre>

  <p>
     To transform the image suse_150.xpm, 'make image=suse_150' is called. <br>
     The resulting program a.out has to be executed.</p>

  <p>
     Then the result, which is displayed on stdout, has to be integrated into
     linux_logo.h. </p>
