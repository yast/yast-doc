<H1>Some things to do - Inspiration out of the Apple Style Guide</H1>
<H1>General Considerations</H1>
<UL>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Does the application have the
	&quot;look&quot; of the Macintosh desktop interface (including, but
	not limited to, desktop, windows, and menus)? 
	</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Does the application have the
	&quot;feel&quot; of the Macintosh desktop interface (including, but
	not limited to, pointing, selecting, and keyboard input)? 
	</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">If a metaphor is being used, is it
	suitable for the application? Does the metaphor match a &quot;real&quot;
	visual and behavioral representation, as with the desktop, so that
	the users do not have to carry a &quot;map&quot; in their head? 
	</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Does the application always
	provide some indication that an activity is being carried out in
	response to a command? 
	</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Is suitable feedback provided
	during task processing? Is the completion of a processing task
	indicated somehow? Is the duration of the task indicated? 
	</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Does the user always have the
	option of finding an object or action on the screen? In other words,
	does your interface follow the see-and-point principle of design? 
	</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Are the operations consistent with
	the standard elements of the interface; that is, if a user is
	familiar with such applications as MacPaint, MacDraw, and MacWrite,
	will the application seem like familiar territory? 
	</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Is a printout a replica of what
	the user sees on the screen? In other words, is it WYSIWYG (what you
	see is what you get)? 
	</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Is an explanation offered if a
	particular action cannot be carried out? <BR>Are alternatives
	offered? 
	</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Are there warnings about risky
	actions? Are there different warnings for different levels of risky
	actions? Are there enough warnings without being too many? Are users
	allowed to back away gracefully from risky territory? 
	</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Is there a feeling of stability? 
	</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">If an operation can be
	interrupted, do you provide a Cancel or Stop button? Can Escape or
	Command-period be used to cancel or stop these operations? 
	</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Is your application forgiving and
	explorable by supporting Undo? 
	</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Do you avoid assigning new
	behaviors to existing objects? 
	</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Do you make all changes clearly
	visible? 
	</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Do you interpret user's responses
	consistently? 
	</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Do you use progressive disclosure,
	as appropriate? 
	</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">When your application runs in the
	background, do you gently call the user's attention to a task
	completion or request for input by using the Notification Manager?
	If an immediate response is crucial and the user doesn't respond to
	a notification request, does your application handle the situation
	gracefully? A background application should not take control from
	the user by placing an alert box on the screen when the user hasn't
	activated the application. 
	</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Is your application MultiFinder
	friendly? Better workflow is possible when the user can easily
	switch back and forth between applications. 
	</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">If there are modes, is there a
	clear visual indication of the current mode? Does the visual
	indication of the mode appear near the object most affected by the
	mode? Are there enough landmarks to remind the user what area of the
	application he or she is in? For example, the MacPaint pointer
	changes to a pencil in draw mode and to a paint brush in paint mode.
		</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Is each mode absolutely necessary?
	Do the modes within the application properly track the user's own
	modes? Do users consistently avoid the kind of errors caused by the
	program being in a mode other than what the user wants or expects?
	Making a mode visually apparent is no guarantee that the user will
	track it: test the application on users and find out what sorts of
	mistakes they are making. If the errors are caused by modes,
	eliminate the modes. 
	</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Can the user save a document or
	quit an application at any time, unless he or she is in a modal
	dialog box? 
	</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Are the widest possible range of
	user activities available at any time? <BR>The user should spend
	most of his or her time in the event loop. 
	</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Will a user unable to distinguish
	colors be able to use the application? Will someone without a color
	monitor be able to use it? The information conveyed by color coding
	should also be presented in another form, <BR>such as text,
	position, highlighting, gray-scale variations, or pattern. <BR>(These
	questions do not apply to programs in which the task to be carried
	out requires full-color vision on a color monitor.) 
	</P>
	<LI><P>Will a user with a hearing disability be able to use the
	application? Audible messages should be supplemented with visual
	cues or should allow the user to choose visible instead of audible
	messages. (This question may not apply to music programs.)</P>
</UL>
<H1>Graphic Design</H1>
<UL>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Did you use graphics to illustrate
	commands, features, and parameters of the applications, as well as
	all of the user's data, whenever possible? 
	</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Do the graphics resemble items
	that users are familiar with? Did you leave out insignificant detail
	(which unnecessarily complicates a graphic)? 
	</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Does the screen look &quot;clean&quot;
	and free from clutter? 
	</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Does the user have control over
	the design of the workplace, allowing him or her to individualize
	it? 
	</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Is the information in windows
	organized so that the most important information can be read first? 
	</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Does your design look good at
	different bit depths on all Macintosh computers? 
	</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Do you use a consistent light
	source, one that always comes from the upper-left corner of the
	screen? 
	</P>
	<LI><P>Do you use white space and graphics to break up long pieces
	of text?</P>
</UL>
<H1>Color</H1>
<UL>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Do you always design for black and
	white first and then colorize <BR>your design? 
	</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Are your black-and-white designs
	two-dimensional? 
	</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Do you avoid using color as the
	only means of communicating important information? 
	</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Are the colors carefully chosen?
	Are bright colors used sparingly and only in small areas? Do you use
	light or subtle colors for large areas? 
	</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Do you maintain a close visual
	relationship between a black-and-white design and its colorized
	version? 
	</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Do you use true gray instead of a
	50 percent gray pattern when a color monitor is present? 
	</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Do you use the Color Picker where
	appropriate? 
	</P>
	<LI><P>Do any custom elements, such as tool palettes or special
	window controls, follow the color scheme of the operating system? Do
	the colors get updated when the user changes the color in the Color
	control panel?</P>
</UL>
<H1>Icons</H1>
<UL>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Do your icons represent objects
	that users are familiar with? 
	</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Do your icons fit in with the
	desktop metaphor? 
	</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Do you provide complete icon
	families, with 'ICN#', 'ics#', 'icl4', 'ics4', 'icl8', and 'ics8'
	icons? 
	</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Are icon colors chosen from the
	palette of 34 colors? 
	</P>
	<LI><P>If your application supports stationery pads, the Edition
	Manager, or the Data Access Manager, do you provide icons that
	distinguish the stationery pads, editions, or query documents for
	your application?</P>
</UL>
<H1>Windows</H1>
<UL>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Do the standard window size and
	position take into account the dimensions of the screen? 
	</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Is the standard state of a window
	best suited to working on the document (such as no wider than the
	page width), and not necessarily as large as the full screen? 
	</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Does your application make sense
	when it chooses to open a window in either the standard or the
	user-selected state? 
	</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Can each sizable window be made as
	large as the smaller of either the maximum document size or the
	maximum size of the displays, including multiple monitor displays?

	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Is the default position of a
	window contained on a single screen?

	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Is each additional window opened
	below and to the right of its predecessor? 
	</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">If a user drags a window from one
	monitor to another monitor, does your application open subsequent
	windows on the second monitor? 
	</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Do you use the lowercase letters
	&quot;untitled&quot; in a new window title? Do <BR>you avoid using
	additional punctuation in window titles? Do you avoid using blank
	titles? Do you avoid adding a number to the title of the first new
	window? 
	</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Before closing a window, do you
	check to see if the user has changed its size or position? Do you
	save window positions, and then reopen windows in the size and
	position in which the user left them? 
	</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Before reopening a window, do you
	make sure that the size and position are reasonable for the user's
	current monitor or monitors, which may not be the same as the
	monitor on which the document was last open? 
	</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">When zooming from the user state
	to the standard state, do you check if the size of the standard
	state would fit completely on the screen without moving the
	upper-left corner? If so, is the upper-left corner anchored? If not,
	is the window moved to an appropriate default location? 
	</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">When a window becomes inactive, do
	the close box, zoom box, size box, stripes in the title bar, and

<H1>Dialog Boxes</H1>
<UL>

	disk?&quot;

	appear on the screen where the user's focus of attention is, not
	necessarily where the menu bar is?

	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Are dialog boxes horizontally

	a drag region (title bar)? Do movable modal dialog boxes not have a

	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Do you provide a Cancel button
	wherever possible, especially in progress dialog boxes? Does
