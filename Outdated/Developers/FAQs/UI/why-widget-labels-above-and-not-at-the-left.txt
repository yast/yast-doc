Currently we simply don't support widget labels at the widget's left side 
rather than above it.

Reasons:

1. Consistent style.

All YaST2 dialogs should look as consistent as we can manage to make them. 
Placement of a widget's label is part of that. If we choose to change that 
from above to the left side, we should do that consistently throughout YaST2 
- which not only would mean _lots_ of work, it's also likely to bring up 
problems very much like that in this original thread, only the other way 
round.


2. Layout would be much more complicated - both for application developers 
and for the layout engine.

Placement of the label above its main widget is a simple layout task:

	Label
	[...(something else)...]

or

	Label
	+--------------------------+
	|                          |
	|                          |
	| (something much higher)  |
	|                          |
	.                          .
	.                          .
	|                          |
	+--------------------------+

The main widget's size is not an issue here - it doesn't matter how high the 
main widget is, neither does it matter how wide it is.

OTOH, consider labels places left:

	Label [...(something else)...]

	LabelThatMayBeSomeWhatLonger [...(something else)...]

	SomeOtherLabel [...(something else)...]

	YetAnotherLabel	+--------------------------+
			|                          |
			|                          |
			| (something much higher)  |
			|                          |
			.                          .
			.                          .
			|                          |
			+--------------------------+

			+--------------------------+
			|                          |
			|                          |
			| (something much higher)  |
	MayBeCentered	|                          |
			.                          .

			|                          |
			+--------------------------+


In order to avoid a layout messed up badly like this, we'd need to specify 
alignments and place all the widgets in some grid layout (which we don't have 
at this point). While the latter is an OPL (*) for all of you (the UI must 
take care of this), the former is something that would have to be taken into 
account by every YCP hacker - everywhere, in each dialog.


What would we gain? Maybe some more input fields / combo boxes in some 
dialogs.

What would we lose? We'd have to cope with _lots_ of empty space due to 
lining up the main widgets properly in each dialog that doesn't have simple 
one-line widgets, but rather selection boxes, tables and other widgets with 
more height.

What we sure don't want IMHO is mix all that up freely. IMHO we should choose 
between labels always on top or always at the left, and I think "always on 
top" comes out on top here given all pros and cons.
