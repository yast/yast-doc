<H1>YaST2: Motivation: Usability</H1>
This is an excerpt from an article by Todd Burgess which originally appeared
<A HREF="http://www.osOpinion.com/Opinions/ToddBurgess/ToddBurgess1.html">here</A>.

<H2>Usability</H2>
        <p>One concept often quoted is user friendliness but this is the only 
          time this article will use the term. Instead the term usability will 
          be used. A system to be usable must satisfy the following criteria: 
        <ol>
          <li> Users must be able to accomplish their goal with minimal effort 
            and maximum results.</li>
          <li> The system must not treat the user in a hostile fashion or treat 
            the user as if they do not matter.</li>
          <li> The system can not crash or produce any unexpected results at any 
            point in the process.</li>
          <li> There must be constraints on the users actions.</li>
          <li> Users should not suffer from information overload.</li>
          <li> The system must be consistent at every point in the process.</li>
          <li> The system must always provide feedback to the user so that they 
            know and understand what is happening at every point in the process.</li>
        </ol>
