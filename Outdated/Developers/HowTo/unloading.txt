Howto on Unloading Components
-----------------------------


SCR
---

For every scr path, there is one file in a scrconf
directory. During startup, the scr does only read the
first line, which contains the scr path.

When the scr path is used, the scr starts (called
mount) the agent. This can be a builtin, plugin or
external program. Example:

  SCR(`Read(.etc.hosts));

You can also explicity mount a scr path:

  SCR(`MountAgent(.etc.hosts));

The gimmick is, you can also unmount a scr path:

  SCR(`UnmountAgent(.etc.hosts));

This destroys the agent, thus freeing it's
memory. Plugins are unloaded and external programs
stopped/killed.


WFM
---

The WFM can create several components, amoung those are
the SCR and the PkgInfo servers. They are created
automatically at the first use, but you have do
terminate them manually. Here is the syntax:

  SCR(`Read(...));		    // creates SCR
  PKGINFO(`setEnvironment(...));    // creates PKGINFO

  SCR();			    // terminates SCR
  PKGINFO();			    // terminates PKGINFO
