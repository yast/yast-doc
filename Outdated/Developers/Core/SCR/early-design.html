<h3>Implementation</h3>
The repository uses a disk based file for persistent and private (i.e. not system dependant) data.
Information about the running system comes either from the <tt>/proc</tt> or the
<tt>/etc</tt> filesystems. Both are accessed by <b>agents</b> which have knowledge
about the file formats and transform the data to and from the representation used
inside the repository library.

Knowledge about data, its type, availability, nameing, etc. is known to the
repository library (configuration file at startup). The library decides how
to access the data (disk based, via agent, ...).
<P>
<h3>Agents</h3>

Agents are used to access data outside the repository library and its own
disk file. This is typically system specific data, e.g. specific configuration
files below <tt>/etc</tt>. This approach allows normal system configuration
by editing configuration files to coexist with workflow driven administration.
It also prevents inconsistencies by keeping a single data source.
<P>
By using write-only agents to reconstruct a configuration file from
data stored in the repository database, it's easy to reconstruct 
configurations destroyed by accident.<br>
This also supports rather complex files (e.g. sendmail.cf) which are
constructed by a set of system commands.
<P>
Agents may also be used to extend the available data by use of <b>repository
servers</b> which provide data common to a set of systems (e.g. clusters).
