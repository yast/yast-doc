<P>
<P>YaST2 is the current installation and configuration software of SuSE Linux. It
comes with a graphical and with a text based user interface. This you should
be familiar with. This document is not concerned about the actual features of
the installation procedure or particular configuration modules that are coming
with SuSE Linux. It's intended for programmers who either want to write their
own YaST2 components, debug those of their fellows or even want to understand
and enhance the core system of YaST2 itself.
<P>However, this document is more aimed to provide you with a general
understanding of YaST2 rather then with actual details of the programming API
or the syntax of YCP. This is better be looked up in the online documentation
that can be found in <CODE>/usr/doc/packages/yast2</CODE> after installing the
YaST2 package.
<P>In the following text I will allow myself to abbreviate YaST2 with Y2.
