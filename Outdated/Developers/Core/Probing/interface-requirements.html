<H1>YaST2: F-Spec: Autoprobe: Interface</H1>
<HR>
<H2>Scope</H2>

This document describes a proposal for a high-level interface
to the hardware autoprobing.

<P>
<H2>Requirements</H2>

The autoprobe library should scan the hardware <b>once</b> at boot and
be prepared to fail. Alternative approaches are to be defined.
<P>
The result of the hardware scan is a 'runtime database' which can be
queried and changed, i.e. by <tt>isapnp -c</tt>.<br>
There should be a way to compare two databases to identify changes due
to added,changed,removed components (i.e. isdn-card added, graphics card
changed, Zip-drive removed).
<P>
The autoprope should concentrate on probing hardware to firmware or
software. For example, it should identify which devices are connected
to a scsi bus but not try to read partition tables from disk drives (this
is considered firmware).

<P>
<H2>Abstraction levels</H2>

<UL>
  <LI>Upper level</LI><BR>
  Highest abstraction, should answer questions like<br>
  - is a mouse attached ?<br>
  - is a network device attached (modem, isdn, ethernet ...) ?<br>
  - do we have local disks ?<br>
  - do we have local cd-rom drives ?<br>
  <P>
  <LI>Middle level</LI><BR>
  Should answer questions like<BR>
  - what kind of mouse ? which device ? (for configuring <tt>gpm</tt><br>
  - is a scsi controller attached ?<br>
  - is a modem attached and where ?<br>
  <P>
  <LI>Lower level</LI><BR>
  Most hardware-dependant level, typical questions are<br>
  - Vendor and type of isdn-card<br>
  - Vendor, type, and capacity of second scsi drive<br>
  - is irq 11 in use ?<br>
