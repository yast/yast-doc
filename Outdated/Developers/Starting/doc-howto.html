<H1>YaST2 Developers pages: doc-howto</H1>

This document gives a short howto on writing documentation for the
YaST2 project.
<p>
It is by no means complete or perfect, suggestions welcome.
<p>
<h2>Scope</h2>
This howto should be used for documenting the analysis and design
phase in YaST2. For implementation, other tools (which will be defined)
should be used.
<p>
This howto does *not* define a clear structure for documentation, it's more
like a <i>style-guide</i>.
<p>
Documentation is for SuSE internal use only.
<p>
<h2>Content</h2>
Documentation should explain <b>what</b> we're doing, <b>why</b> we're doing
it this way, and <b>how</b> we're doing it.<br>
It must be <b>exhaustive</b> on the topic. Don't try to explain the world, stick
with the topic but don't slip important parts.<br>
<b>Structurize</b> your document,
give an overview first, then go into detail. Spread the details over several
documents if needed. Don't write more than about two pages per document.<br>
It must be <b>consistent</b>, in itself and in regard to other documents.<br>
<b>Don't repeat</b> yourself. If you introduce a new concept, explain it once. Don't
try to repeat, either verbatim or with other wordings.<br>
Most important, it must be <b>correct</b>. Hand your document to someone else
for checking.<br>

<p>
<h2>Language</h2>
Documentation should be written in
english and use the HTML syntax.<br>
<p>
<H2>Structure</h2>
     The document should be structured. This is best done with further
     headings. However, these should *not* be <tt>&lt;H1&gt;</tt> headings.
     <tt>&lt;H2&gt;</tt> or <tt>&lt;H2&gt;</tt> is acceptable.<br>
     Another approach to (optical) sturturization is (probably nested) <tt>&lt;ul&gt;</tt> without
     <tt>&lt;li&gt;</tt> which gives nice indentation.
<br><p>
<h2>The text</h2>
  Use enough <tt>&lt;br&gt;</tt> and <tt>&lt;p&gt;</tt> in your text.<br>
  Set verbatim examples or multiline code in <tt>&lt;pre&gt;</tt> <tt>&lt;/pre&gt;</tt><br>
  Set commands and filenames in <tt>&lt;tt&gt;</tt> <tt>&lt;/tt&gt;</tt><br>
  Emphasize with <tt>&lt;i&gt;</tt> <tt>&lt;/i&gt;</tt><br>
  Highlight important words (esp. concepts when first mentioned) with <tt>&lt;b&gt;</tt> <tt>&lt;/b&gt;</tt><br>
  Sometimes <tt>&lt;hr&gt;</tt> is useful when changing the subject.<br>
<br><p>
<h2>The footer</h2>
  The document should end with <tt>&lt;p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</tt>, a 'last changed'
  remark, the author, and a copyright. All should be set <tt>&lt;smaller&gt;</tt>
  <br>Again, look at the current source.
