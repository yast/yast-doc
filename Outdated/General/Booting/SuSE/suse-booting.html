<H1>YaST2: Analysis: Booting: SuSE Linux</H1>

<H2>Scope</H2>

This document describes the <b>initial boot</b> of SuSE Linux from
a boot disk or CD-ROM. It also explains, why the setup was choosen.

<H2>Disk Format</H2>

The boot disk is MS-DOS compatible, so users can 'see' the disk under
DOS and Windows. Having a ext2fs (linux standard) or minix (most efficient)
filesystem will increase load on I-Support with people complaining about
'empty' disks.
<P>
This filesystem also allows exchanging the kernel by copying a different
kernel image from CD-ROM to disk on a Windows system.

<P>
<H2>Boot loader</H2>
Syslinux was choosen instead of lilo for it's support of the DOS filesystem.
Lilo needs to know the <i>physical</i> location of the kernel on the disk,
hence the need to call 'lilo' after installing a new kernel.
<P>
Syslinux also supports a 'boot up' message to have an initial screen for
the user.

<P>
<H2>Ram Disk Format</H2>
The initial ramdisk (<tt>initrd.gz</tt>) and the modules (<tt>scsi-mod.gz</tt> and
<tt>net-mod.gz</tt>) have minix filesystem. This is the most efficient filesystem
and can be fine-tuned to lowest overhead. The minix fs module is also the smallest.
