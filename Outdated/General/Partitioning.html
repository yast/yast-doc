<h1>YaST2: analaysis: Partition</H1>
 
This document describes the needed partitions for
supported platforms:

<h2>Intel Platform</h2>

   <ul>

   <p>
      The root partition must exist. <p>

   <p>
      There are no special restrictions on partitions,
      they can be primary or logical on extended 
      partitions. </p>

   <p>
      Linux needs at least one partition, namely for its root
      file system, the mount point is '/'.
      It can use swap files and/or <b>swap partitions</b>,
      but the latter are more efficient. So, usually  one
      will want a second Linux partition dedicated as swap partition.
      On Intel compatible hardware, the BIOS that boots
      the system can often only access the first 1024 cylinders
      of the hard disk. For this reason people with large disks
      often create a third partition, just a few MB large, typically
      mounted on /boot, to store the kernel image and a
      few auxiliary files needed at boot time, so as to make
      sure that this stuff is accessible to the BIOS. </p>

   <p> <strong>proposal for Intel compatible hardware</strong> <br>
      <ul>
      <li> /boot ( ca 10 MB )
      <li> /swap ( ca 128 MB )
      <li> / ( remaining space )
      </ul> <p> </p>
   </ul> <p> </p>

<h2>Alphas</h2>
   
   <ul>

   <p>
      A special partition must exist for starting the 
      kernel. <p>

   <p>
      Also the root partition must exist. <p>

   <p>
      There are two different consoles, and causing
      two different boot disks: MILO disks for ARCS / NT-bios
      consoles and aboot disks for SRM consoles.

   <p>
      For the ARCSbios there must be a DOS or NTFS partition. <br>
      It is recommended to have a DOS and a /boot partition,
      both 10 MB large. </p>

   <p> <strong>proposal for ARCSbios consoles</strong> <br>
      <ul>
      <li> /boot ( ca 10 MB )
      <li> /dos ( ca 10 MB )
      <li> /swap ( ca 128 MB )
      <li> / ( remaining space )
      </ul> <p> </p>

   <p>
      For the SRM console there must be a BSD partition. <br>
      (not supported by YAST at the moment) </p>

   <p> <strong>proposal for SRM consoles</strong> <br>
      <ul>
      <li> don't use the begin of the hard disk
      <li> /swap ( RAM multilpied by two )
      <li> / ( remaining space )
      </ul> <p> </p>

<h3>known problems</h3>

<p>
http://www.home.unix-ag.org/nils/Alpha/Common-AXP-Problems.html: <br>
MILO might have problems when trying to boot kernels from
beyond 2GB on your harddisk. My solution is to have a small
boot partition at the beginning of my disk just containing
my kernel images. <br>
MILO also has problems with symbolic links so do not try to
boot from a symlink ;) <br>
A newer version of MILO capable of symlinks is rumored to hide at
ftp://genie.ucd.ie/pub/alpha/milo/ with the name milo-2.0.35-0.1.tar.gz
