<H1>YaST2: Motivation: Intro</H1>
YaST2 is a new tool for installing, configuring and administration of SuSE (or any other version of) Linux.
 At least, this is the long term target.
<p>
We will use our current knowledge of YaST1 and a look on competing products to
achieve:
<ol>
<li><b>Publicity</b></li>
<li><b>Making Linux easier</b></li>
<li><b>Less work for the ISupport</b></li>
<li><b>Designing a widely accepted system</b></li>
</ol>
The first point means nothing more and nothing less than <b>Show-effect</b>. That´s
good for marketing and for the acceptance of linux with ´Joe Nerd´. We´ll
need good graphics, speed and a point-and-click path to a running system.
<p>
Making linux easier essentially means automatic workflows. The system should
lead the user to his goal, giving hints whereever possible and never, <b>never</b>
offer choices that won't work. Just count the number of ´howtos´ and ´step-by-step´
articles in the sdb that can be automated.<br>
<p>
Besides the consumer market (read: wintel-users on standard pc hardware), we also
want to support other systems (alpha, sparc, ppc, ...) and less common configurations
(larger networks, laptops, cluster).<br>
So our solution should not make too many assumptions about the system (well, besides
being a linux based system) and must be easily adaptable to new situations.
<p>
The design must keep the acceptance in the linux community in mind. Focussing just
on technological issues will lead to a complex system with a steep learning curve.<br>
If we want a whitespread solution, it must be simple, easy to learn and documented.
<hr>
The key idea to achieve our goals is the <b>workflow</b>.
<p>
Workflow means to change the description of administrative steps and commands
from text-based to program-based. A workflow can describe the setup of an
ISDN-PPP access or the complete installation of your whiz-bang ACME laptop model 42.
The latter could be made even easier by providing a pre-configured workflow
script with most data already filled in.
<p>
Everything expressable in a program can be imagined. By combining smaller workflow
steps with an easy to learn scripting language, complex workflows can be formed.
Every step has a precondition, that must be fulfilled before this step can
be done. After execution of the step, a postcondition is set which describes
how successful the step was. This network of conditions can be controlled
by software just like 'rpm' controls software dependencies.
<p>
Interaction with the user is done by a user-interface separated from the
workflow. This allows a free implementation of the look and feel and makes
networking transparent. A clear separation of Form and Function is extremely
important.
