<H1>YaST2: RSpec: YaST1</H1>
This chapter briefly positions YaST2 in contrast to YaST1.
<HR>
YaST1 is a widely accepted and respected solution to the installation
and administration requirements of a linux distribution. However, it
tries to be everything to everyone combining all tasks in a single program.
<P>
This "one-for-all" approach is currently the biggest obstacle in keeping
YaST1 in sync with the requirements of a modern linux distribution. The code
has grown over the past years to a state where it's almost unmanageable.
Currently only two people have knowledge about the code and they're the
loudest in crying "don't touch it and don't use it".
<P>
The YaST1 interface is respected and most SuSE customers won't abandon it
lightly. For that very reason, YaST2 must not break with the interface concept from YaST1.
<P>
The most often heard demand for YaST1 is a graphical (point-and-click) interface.
At least, using the mouse on the current text-based interface should be possible.
Due to instabilities which may be introduced by such an extension, the YaST1 
maintainers refuse to add this functionality.
<P>
Another important point is the shift of the target market for SuSE Linux. This
moves away from the current programmer in two directions: Windows users and
corporate users.<BR>
The first needs an easy installation, the second needs an easy (and network-capable)
administration. Both issues are not addressed by YaST1.
<P>
For YaST2, we must focus on
<UL>
the customer market (most important)
<UL>graphical interface<BR>
automatic installation<BR>
automatic recognition of changed/added hardware components<BR>
extensive, context-sensitive help<BR>
internationalisation<BR>

<BR>the corporate market
<UL>
