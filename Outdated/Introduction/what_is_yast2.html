<H1>YaST2: What is YaST2 ?</H1>

<bigger>
YaST2 is a replacement for YaST1 for<BR>
<P>
<ul>
<li>installation</li>
<li>configuration</li>
<li>administration</li>
</ul>
of a (SuSE) linux system.
</bigger>
<P>

<H2>Key concept</H2>

The key concept is the strict separation of
<BR>
<ul>
the user interface<BR>
the software implementing an administrative task<BR>
the data (config files, etc.)<BR>
</ul>
<P>
<H3>Workflows</H3>
To make the system usable for the casual user, <B>workflows</B> are used
to direct the user through the steps neccessary to accomplish a specific task.
<BR>
The user isn´t forced to do it this way, but the system can offer as much
help as possible. Ideally, each workflow has a 'novice' and an 'expert' 
mode. The novice mode fills in default values and tries to determine as
much as possible automatically. The expert has full control and can even
enter unreasonable values.
<P>
By providing pre-configured workflows and configuration data, it will be
possible to automate specific tasks. From adding a user, to installing a
completely configured Linux on a specialized hardware, everything should
be possible.

<P>
<H3>Modules</H3>
Every workflow will be assembled in small steps, implemented by <B>Modules</B>
and hold together by a small by comfortable scripting language.
<P>
Modules have a predefined interface and can be written in any computer language.
The <B>YaST2 control language</B> (ycp) can be used to <EM>glue</EM> modules together
or to write a module by itself.<BR>
This building block approach makes constructing complex workflows easy and
maintainable.
<P>
From an outside view, there is no real difference between a module and a workflow.
The term <B>module</B> is used to describe a small step of a workflow. The term
<B>workflow</B> is used to describe a specific administrative tasks, i.e. the
way from "What do you want to do?" to "Ok, all done and ready".

<P>
<H3>User interface</H3>
The ycp language is also used to control the user interface. User interfaces
present information to and retrieve information from the user.<p> Initially a
curses (text) and Qt 2.0 (X11) based user interface will be implemented,
both with the same API.

<P>
<H3>Repository</H3>
All configuration and system data can be accessed via the <B>System Configuration
Repository</B> (<A HREF="intro_to_scr.html">SCR</A>) library.<BR>
It presents a consitent view on all kinds of data, either YaST2 internal or
original config files residing in <TT>/etc</TT> for example. By implementing
<EM>agents</EM> to parse and write program- or system-specific config files,
no one is forced to use YaST2 for administration.

<P>
<H3>Conclusion</H3>
The modular structure of YaST2 will make it maintainable and extendable. The
YaST2 control language implements a common API to use modules as clients
to other programs.<br>
If workflows are implemented correctly, installation and administration
can be made more fool-proof.
The repository library gives an easy tool to distribute workflows and
configuration data. The data source can also be a file (preconfigured
workflow) or a server (for cluster configuration).
<P>
The following picture gives a rough view on the building blocks for YaST2.
