<H1>Introduction</H1>

Although YaST2 was triggered as a reaction on the Caldera 2.2 and RedHat 6.0
releases, it won´t just mirror their concepts but go far beyond.<br>
Our ultimate goal is a new <B>installation and administration tool</B> for Linux in general.
<P>
This is an enormous task which isn't adequately solved even by the 'big'
unix companies as Sun, HP, or IBM. In the linux market, only linuxconf tries
to provide a common solution to administration.<BR>
Given current resources, we won't be able to provide a comprehensive solution
in short time. Even with more people, it just takes time to collect the
necessary knowledge and provide a usable interface on this 'information
database'.
<P>
The most important <B>requirements</B> for YaST2 are<P>
<B>automated workflow</B><BR>
<B>graphical interface</B><BR>
<B>internationalisation</B><BR>
<B>maintainable, extendable</B><BR>
<P>
To make the task manageable, it is broken into <B>small, independent parts</B>. If the
implementation of one part shows to be inadequate, it shall be replaced without
affecting the system as a whole. Having a set of exchangeable modules is
the preferred solution.

<H2>Scope</H2>
We first <B>focus on system installation</B> in the YaST2 project. In designing and
implementing this part, we try to identify <B>reusable steps</B> in the process. For example,
configuring a network device, needed to boot from a server, is also an
administrative tasks when installing a network card. The steps, dependencies, and
the user interface should be the same in both usages.
<P>
The first version will be used to collect and represent knowledge for the
further development. Going from an intel-pci based installation tool to a
network-capable configuration management is huge task which has to be done
in small, incremental steps.
